# Data Science Porfolio 

This repo is intended to be a portfolio of my data science & ML projects.
While pursuing my Masters in Data Analytics in National University of Ireland Galway, I 
was exposed to wide varity of data science modules. The modules I enjoyed the most were:

- Case Studies in Data Analytics
- Large Scale Data Analytics
- Applied Statistics
- Data Vizualisation
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Network Science

## Deep Learning

Classical statistical methods of modeling and predicting are sometimes not useful in many data science applications. Areas we observe non-linear relationships between explanatory variables and response variables are the most notable. Eg: Image Classification, Text anaytics etc

An example of usign advanced deep learning techniques to derice value from unstructed text data is sentiment analysis. Long Short-Term memory neural networks work very well as [demonstrated here] (./Deep%20Learning/IMDBMovieReviewClassification.ipynb)

## Network Science

Perhaps the oddest choice of the available modules, the techniques learnt here can be applied across different scientific disciplines without requiring a great deal of prior knowledge. DNA sequences, human social networks, ecological food chains, the interconnection of web pages etc can all be represented  effectively in terms of graphs. These graphs can be then used to derive knowledge on the networks.

A topic modelling effort on the word association networks is [available here](./Network%20Science/WordAssociation.pdf)
