# Data Science Porfolio 

This repo is intended to be a portfolio of my data science & ML projects.
While pursuing my Masters in Data Analytics in National University of Ireland Galway, I 
was exposed to wide varity of data science modules. The modules I enjoyed the most were:

- Case Studies in Data Analytics
- Large Scale Data Analytics
- Applied Statistics
- Data Vizualisation
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Network Science

## Network Science

Perhaps the oddest choice of the available modules, the techniques learnt here can be applied across different scientific disciplines without requiring a great deal of prior knowledge. DNA sequences, human social networks, ecological food chains, the interconnection of web pages etc can all be represented  effectively in terms of graphs. These graphs can be then used to derive knowledge on the networks.

A topic modelling effort on the word association networks is [available here] (./Network Science/)
